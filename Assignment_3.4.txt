1. HDFS federation and high availability

In Hadoop 1.x
In HDFS federation,there exists multiple namenodes each having fsimage, edit and block
mapping of different portions of HDFS
In HDFS High availability, multiple NameNodes are used in the Active-Standby mode with
shared edits to handle the NameNode failure.
In Hadoop 2.x
In HDFS federation,there are multiple Namenodes, each storing metadata and block mapping of files
and directories contained in particular sub-directories
The list of sub-directories managed by a NameNode is called a namespace volume
The namespace volumes are divided among namenodes and not among the data nodes.
Even when one namenode fails, other namenodes are accessible which makes sure that the entire cluster
is not a waste.
In high availabilty, each  data node sends the data that is stored by it to all the name nodes 
so that in case of one namenode failure, the data can be retrieved from the other namenode's data.
 
2. Handling failures during write by HDFS

1. The pipeline is closed and any packets in the ack(acknowledgement) queue are added to the front of the data
queue
2. The current block on the good DataNodes is given a new identity, which is communicated to
the NameNode
3. The failed DataNode is removed from the pipeline, and a new pipeline is constructed from
the two good DataNodes
4. The remainder of the block’s data is written to the good DataNodes in the pipeline
5. The NameNode notices that the block is under-replicated, and it arranges for a further
replica to be created on another node
6. As long as dfs.namenode.replication.min replicas (which defaults to 1) are written, the
write will succeed
7. The block will be asynchronously replicated across the cluster until its target replication factor is reached.(by default it would be 3)
